This Quick Start can deploy FortiGate on-demand or bring-your-own-license (BYOL) instances. You pay an hourly fee based on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance type. A license is required for each FortiGate BYOL instance you might use. Licenses can be purchased from FortiCare. When you launch the Quick Start, place the license key in an S3 bucket and specify its location. For instructions, see step 3 in the deployment section.

//TODO Shivansh, This paragraph still includes the bracketed text <AMI information>. I plan to delete this phrase. First, please confirm that the paragraph following it is complete and accurate. For example, it mentions only two AMI options. Elsewhere in the guide we list three. 
//TODO Shivansh, There's a nonworking cross-ref to a step number here. Do you know how to make that link work in Asciidoc? I don't see anything in the documentation on this.
