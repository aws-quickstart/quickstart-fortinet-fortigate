== Test the deployment

Fortinet FortiGate Auto Scaling creates two Auto Scaling groups with an elected main instance.

.	Confirm that the Auto Scaling groups were created after completion of the CloudFormation stack.
The name of each group starts with the prefix you specified in *Resource tag prefix*. Confirm that the number in the *Instances* column is equal to or greater than the capacity you specified in the *Desired* column.

.	Confirm that a primary instance was elected.
Look up the DynamoDB table <ResourceTagPrefix>-FortiGateMasterElection. Select the Items tab and open the master record (the only item listed). A master has been elected when the voteState is done.

. Make note of the instance ID (`instanceID`). You will need it to connect to the main FortiGate instance.


== Post-deployment steps
// If Post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

=== Connect to the Primary FortiGate instance

To connect to the main FortiGate instance, you need a login URL, a user name, and a password.

.	Construct the login URL in this way: https://<IPAddress>:<Port>/.
<Port> refers to the parameter *Admin port* specified during FortiGate configuration.
<IPAddress> refers to the IPv4 public IP address of the FortiGate. This IP address is listed under the *Description* tab for the instance, as shown in <<post_deployment_1>>. In the Amazon EC2 management console, locate the instance using the instance ID of the main instance.

+ 
.	Open an HTTPS session and go to the login URL.
+
Your browser displays a certificate error message. This is normal because the default FortiGate certificate is self-signed and not recognized by browsers. Proceed past this error. Later, you can upload a publicly signed certificate to avoid this error.
+
.	Log in to the FortiGate with the user name *admin* and the default password *<instanceID>*.
+
This is the initial password for all FortiGate instances because the main FortiGate propagates the password to all secondary FortiGate instances. If failover occurs before the password is changed, you will need this initial password since the newly elected main FortiGate will still have the initial password of the previous main instance.
+
. When you are prompted at the first-time login, change the password. 
+
NOTE: Change the password only on the main FortiGate instance. This instance propagates the password to all FortiGates in the Auto Scaling group. Any password changed on a secondary FortiGate is overwritten with the main FortiGate's password.
+
The FortiGate dashboard opens. The information displayed in the license widget of the dashboard depends on your license type.

=== Fortinet FortiGate Auto Scaling on AWS features 

==== Major components

*	*The BYOL Auto Scaling group:* This group contains FortiGates of the BYOL licensing model. These instances dynamically scale out or scale in based on the scaling metrics specified by the parameters *Scale-out threshold* and *Scale-in threshold*. For each instance you must provide a valid license purchased from FortiCare. For BYOL-only and hybrid licensing deployments, the minimum group size (`FgtAsgMinSizeByol`) must be at least 2. These FortiGates are the main instances and are fixed and running 7x24. If it is set to 1 and the instance fails to work, the current FortiGate configuration is lost.

*	*The on-demand Auto Scaling group:* This group contains FortiGates of the on-demand licensing model. These instances dynamically scale out or scale in based on the scaling metrics specified by the parameters *Scale-out threshold* and *Scale-in threshold*. For on-demand-only deployments, the minimum group size (`FgtAsgMinSizePayg`) must be at least 2. These FortiGates are the main instances and are fixed and running 7x24. If it is set to 1 and the instance fails to work, the current FortiGate configuration is lost.

*	*The `assets/configset` directory in the S3 bucket:* This directory contains the following files that are loaded as the initial configuration for a new FortiGate instance.
**	`baseconfig` is the base configuration. This file can be modified as needed to meet your network requirements. Placeholders such as {SYNC_INTERFACE} are explained in the "Configset placeholders" table that follows.
**	`httproutingpolicy` and `httpsroutingpolicy` specify the FortiGate firewall policy for virtual IP addresses (VIPs) for http routing and https routing, respectively. They're provided as part of the base `configset`for a common use case. This use case includes a VIP on port 80 and a VIP on port 443 with a policy that points to an internal load balancer. The port numbers are configurable and can be changed during CFT deployment. Additional VIPs can be added here as needed. Note that in FortiOS 6.2.3, any VIPs created on the main instance do not sync to the secondary units. Any VIP you wish to add must be added as part of the base configuration. If you set the `InternalLoadBalancingOptions` parameter to *Do not need one*, append your VIP configuration to `baseconfig`.
** (Optional) The `assets/fgt-asg-license` directory in the S3 bucket contains BYOL license files.

*	*The tables in DynamoDB:* These tables are required to store information such as health-check monitoring, main-instance election, and state transitions. Do not modify these records unless required for troubleshooting purposes.
*	*The networking components:* These components include the Network Load Balancers, the target group, and the VPC and subnets. You are expected to create your own client and server instances that you want protected by the FortiGate.

==== Configset placeholders

When the FortiGate requests the configuration from the FortiGate Auto Scaling handler function, the placeholders in the following table are replaced with actual values for the Auto Scaling group.

[cols="3",options="header",grid=rows,frame=topbot]
|===
|Placeholder  |Type | Description
|*{SYNC_INTERFACE}*
|Text
|The interface for FortiGates to synchronize information. Specify as port1, port2, port3, etc. All characters must be lowercase.
|*{CALLBACK_URL}*	
|URL	
|The endpoint URL to interact with the Auto Scaling handler script. Automatically generated during AWS CloudFormation deployment.
|*{PSK_SECRET}*	
|Text	
|The preshared key used in FortiOS. Specified during AWS CloudFormation deployment.
|*{ADMIN_PORT}*	
|Number	
|A port number specified for administrator login. A positive integer, such as 443. Specified during AWS CloudFormation deployment.
|*{HEART_BEAT_INTERVAL}*	
|Number	
|The time interval (in seconds) that the FortiGate waits between sending heartbeat requests to the Auto Scaling handler function.
|===

==== Auto Scaling handler environment variables

[cols="2",options="header",grid=rows,frame=topbot]
|===
|Variable name | Description
|*UNIQUE_ID*	
|Reserved, empty string.
|*CUSTOM_ID*	
|Reserved, empty string.
|*RESOURCE_TAG_PREFIX*	
|The value of the CFT parameter *Resource tag prefix*, which is described in the table *Resource tagging configuration.*
