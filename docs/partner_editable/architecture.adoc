As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnets:

**	A FortiGate host in an Auto Scaling group complements AWS security groups to provide intrusion protection, web filtering, and threat detection to help protect your services from cyber-attacks. It also allows VPN access by authorized users.

**	The master FortiGate in the Auto Scaling group(s) acts as a NAT gateway, allowing outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*

*	A public-facing Network Load Balancer is created as a part of the deployment process. A private-facing Network Load Balancer is optional.

*	AWS Lambda, which provides the core Auto Scaling functionality between FortiG.

*	An Amazon DynamoDB database that uses Fortinet-provided scripts to store information about Auto Scaling condition states.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
